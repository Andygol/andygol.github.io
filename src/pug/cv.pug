                                            p I am a long-time contributor to the <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> project. I not only participate in adding new data and updating existing information, but also put a lot of effort into localizing tools and documentation into Ukrainian to attract more participants from Ukraine. I translated and maintained the interfaces of such editors as <a href="https://ideditor.org/">iD</a> and <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM</a>, translated the documentation in the OSM Wiki, helped in the preparation of issues for the <a href="https://weeklyosm.eu/uk">weeklyOSM</a>. In addition, I created a website for the <a href="https://openstreetmap.org.ua">Ukrainian OpenStreetMap Community</a> and helped to establish cooperation with corporate users, one of whom created and maintains a tile server for use in Ukraine.
                                            p However, my efforts are not limited to the Ukrainian community. I have updated and offered to the community site that facilitate the wide dissemination of <a href="https://andygol.co.ua/welcome-mat-osmf/">information about the project</a> and <a href="https://andygol.co.ua/switch2osm-mkdocs/">Switch2OSM</a>, guidance on the transition to using OpenStreetMap.

                                            p 3D printing became my hobby not long ago. I documented my first steps in this hobby on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AndriiHolovin">YouTube channel</a>. I also made efforts to localize the <a href="https://snapmaker.com/snapmaker-luban">Luban slicer</a> to 100% in Ukrainian. Not only the interface was localized, but also the built-in help.
                                            p I have a universal 3D printer that also has a laser for cutting and engraving. And I managed to cut a model of the landscape of the island from plywood, see more about it <a href="https://blog.andygol.co.ua/en/2022/02/10/making-a-model-of-an-island-using-plywood/">here</a>.
